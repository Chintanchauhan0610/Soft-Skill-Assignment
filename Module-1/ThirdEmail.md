Subject: Request for Salary Review

Dear Ms.Chauhan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to respectfully request a review of my current salary. Over the past , I have consistently taken on additional responsibilities and have worked to meet and exceed the expectations of my role.

I believe my contributions to team, along with my commitment to delivering quality work, justify a discussion regarding a possible salary adjustment. I remain highly motivated to continue contributing to the company’s growth and success.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this at your convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
